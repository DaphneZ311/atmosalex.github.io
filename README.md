## Creating a Website for your AOS C111/204 Final Project

### Copy this site as a template
1.	Follow steps to create repository *[user].github.io* without a README file, where *[user]* is your GitHub username
2.	Clone this template repository
3.	Go to the *Settings* tab, then click *Pages* (under *Code and automation*), and check that the *Build and deployment* section looks like this: ![](/assets/IMG/instr_bd.png)
4.	Go to the *Actions* tab and check that the build and deployment action has finished. Once it has, navigate to [user].github.io in your browser to see your site.

### Change the theme (optional)
1.	Choose your favourite theme [from this page](https://pages.github.com/themes/)
2.	Replace `theme: jekyll-theme-minimal` with `theme: jekyll-theme-[name]` where `[name]` is the name of the theme from the above list

### Change your site logo (optional)
1. In your repository, upload a logo or profile picture to the `assets/IMG/` directory
2. Open `_config.yml` and change the line `logo: /assets/IMG/template_IMG.png` to point to your new image

### Adding content
* This file acts like your home page. Replace its contents with whatever you want the world to see.
* You can create other markdown files (.md) in your repository and navigate to them from this page using links, i.e.: [`project.md`](project.md)
* Check a [guide to writing Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), or ask [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) for help.
* When writing in a markdown file, it is useful to wrap the text by selecting the *Soft wrap* option as shown: ![](/assets/IMG/instr_wrap.png)

## Include a link to your project from this page
Here is a template file for your report: [`project.md`](project.md)
